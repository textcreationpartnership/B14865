            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>Of forrein princes yoake, was glad of her,</l>

               <l>Her entertainment was in such a sort,</l>
               <l>For majestie of state and princely cheere,</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:177531:5"/>
               <l>As in all points she did content them all.</l>
               <l>Nay, diuers noble Dames whom like desire,</l>
               <l>Enflamed for to see the object of their eares,</l>
               <l>Did vndertake the way though nere so long</l>
               <l>By sea, by land to see that they did seeke:</l>
               <l>What honour were these things to this our Isle?</l>
               <l>What glorie to all those of that her sex?</l>
               <l>That forraine lands should send both Ladies and Lords</l>
               <l>To heare our princes voice, to see her face,</l>
               <l>To kisse her faire and tender royall hand.</l>
               <l>This was her publicke course in case of state,</l>
               <l>Whereof the world each where eye witnesse was.</l>
               <l>Now as she was addicted still to heare,</l>
               <l>Or priuatly to read some learned booke,</l>
               <l>She neuer brook't, nor could with patience beare</l>
               <l>What she perceiu'd vnseeming for a Prince,</l>
               <l>But as her choice was euer of the best</l>
               <l>And chiefest that did write in any tongue,</l>
               <l>So what she found to be sincere and pure,</l>
               <l>That did she note and laid it vp in store,</l>
               <l>VVhat was not such, as sorie she had red</l>
               <l>That she exil'd both from her eie and eare.</l>
               <l>If ought came by the way while she did read,</l>
               <l>VVhich smelt of blood or cruell tyrants hand,</l>
               <l>Her selfe rejected straight, and willed him</l>
               <l>That red with her, to read the same alone,</l>
               <l>And after tell it her in milder phrase.</l>
               <l>Nay farther, if the lawes by force of right</l>
               <l>Condemned any one for crime to die,</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:177531:5"/>
               <l>None was more loath to yeeld to such a death,</l>
               <l>None more desired to respit time for life</l>
               <l>Her nature was so mild, her heart so kind,</l>
               <l>As paine or death deseru'd could hardly winne,</l>
               <l>Though law and justice both did bid her strike.</l>
               <l>Besides when any of her priuate traine</l>
               <l>Did painfully perfourme his charge in truth,</l>
               <l>How would she cherish him with courteous termes,</l>
               <l>Alluring euerie heart to yeeld her loue,</l>
               <l>Of which her gentle course well fitting her.</l>
               <l>This may be brought for proofe, that being sicke,</l>
               <l>No Ladie of her suit refused paines</l>
               <l>By night, by day, to saue their princes health,</l>
               <l>But euerie one with danger of their owne,</l>
               <l>Did seeke to saue her life whom they so lou'd:</l>
               <l>And as the women did, so did the men</l>
               <l>VVith earnest care in dutie to perfourme</l>
               <l>That sorrowfull seruice, with losse of prince to liue.</l>
               <l>By nature such she was, by vertue such</l>
               <l>As none deny'd her loue, where she did like.</l>
               <l>To knit the last with least, whatsoeuer thing,</l>
               <l>She vndertooke, to daunce, to play, to sing,</l>
               <l>Or what so else a modest Queene might doe,</l>
               <l>That she perfourm'd with majestie and grace,</l>
               <l>That it became the place, that it beseem'd a Queene.</l>
               <l>Now drawing neere to death, she stay'd on still,</l>
               <l>The faith she held in life she kept in death,</l>
               <l>That though they which were neere her when she dyed,</l>
               <l>VVere for her death in paine and extreame griefe,</l>
               <l>And could haue wisht her longer time to liue:</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:177531:6"/>
               <l>Yet they rejoic'd to see her so depart</l>
               <l>As in her death they saw a present life:</l>
               <l>For at her death she did remember well</l>
               <l>Both what concern'd her soule, her heauenly state,</l>
               <l>And how she must depart without delay,</l>
               <l>As when her soule her mortall bodie left</l>
               <l>VVith triumph she did mount straight into heauen.</l>
               <l>Nor when she died, she did forget hers here,</l>
               <l>As many mothers doe forget their babes,</l>
               <l>But left vs such a King whose vertues might</l>
               <l>Abridge the griefe which lacke of her might breed.</l>
               <l>This was her end, this was her liues last act</l>
               <l>VVith clap of hands for sorrow, but not for joy,</l>
               <l>For who can but bewaile the losse of such a prince?</l>
               <l>What time can serue to stint the streame of wofull teares?</l>
               <l>For who is't we haue lost? a prince whom man did not,</l>
               <l>But God alone did choose protector of his word,</l>
               <l>The trumpet of his truth, a mother to vs all,</l>
               <l>A pillar to all peace, a death to all debate.</l>
               <l>The honour of her sex, a Queene surmounting match,</l>
               <l>Of whom when all is said, all is not enough.</l>
               <l>I must confesse we haue just cause to grieue,</l>
               <l>But yet two greater grounds rebate our griefe</l>
               <l>The first because her age, her seauentie yeares</l>
               <l>Had made her ripe, and readie for to die.</l>
               <l>If she had been before a maried Queene,</l>
               <l>Or not haue vs'd a diet low and spare,</l>
               <l>Her life had not endur'd in strength so long.</l>
               <l>She died in happie raigne, not feeling crosse</l>
               <l>Belou'd at home, admir'd abroad, a matchlesse prince,</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:177531:6"/>
               <l>So that it seems she changed onely place</l>
               <l>By such a blessed death cal'd vp to heauen,</l>
               <l>VVhere here on earth she raignd in fits of care.</l>
               <l>Now who so shall bewaile one dying so,</l>
               <l>So throughly bles'd, in state so perfect good,</l>
               <l>He shall not seeme to mourne for her he mones,</l>
               <l>But to lament for losse of priuate gaine.</l>
               <l>And yet an earnest loue cannot but mourne,</l>
               <l>VVhen cause whence loue did rise hath his recourse</l>
               <l>VVhich bred and borne on ground that beares it vp,</l>
               <l>Cannot be tryed at all with shed of teares.</l>
               <l>The second cause which ought to stay our griefe,</l>
               <l>And that may seeme the proper cure to care</l>
               <l>Is, that the Queene, when death approched her,</l>
               <l>Did stint where all our griefe for her should stay,</l>
               <l>By pointing vs a King, and that a man</l>
               <l>Accustomed to rule: one of our English blood,</l>
               <l>VVhich all his time hath fostered vp Gods truth,</l>
               <l>A friend to peace, a prince of mightie skill,</l>
               <l>To whom our Queene, our good <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Did yeeld, as to a prince her peere each way,</l>
               <l>So that although we grieue for losse of her,</l>
               <l>Yet this one close should knit vp all our griefe,</l>
               <l>For that by her owne choise and right of blood,</l>
               <l>VVe haue a King to turne our greefe to joy.</l>
               <l>Now my liege Lord, successour to my Queene,</l>
               <l>The greatest King that Brittish soyle hath seene,</l>
               <l>Thou seest a mightie patterne in thine eie</l>
               <l>A maiden prince which ruled so this state,</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:177531:7"/>
               <l>As to match her tis much, to passe her more.</l>
               <l>Wherefore thy charge is doubled in our eyes,</l>
               <l>VVhich are in hope that thou wilt follow her steps,</l>
               <l>And rule as she did raigne with equall praise,</l>
               <l>Which thing that thou maist doe both long, and safe, and sound,</l>
               <l>Thou must of force with Iesuites be at warre,</l>
               <l>VVhose doctrine is to spare no princes blood,</l>
               <l>To rob them of their state, to rob them of their liues,</l>
               <l>VVith fire and sword to force them for to yeeld:</l>
               <l>If they, (though God himselfe forbid the same)</l>
               <l>Yeeld not their royall necks to popish foot,</l>
               <l>The blood of Kings is Iesuites inke to write,</l>
               <l>That liquour is it must make their Rubricks red.</l>
               <l>Will he spare <hi>Iames</hi> our King, which spared not our Queen?</l>
               <l>Will he forbeare a man, which preyed vpon a maid?</l>
               <l>She though she caught him oft, yet spar'd him oft,</l>
               <l>Which hope in him is dead through such a King,</l>
               <l>Who hath from Gods owne mouth commandement giuen,</l>
               <l>With double paine the bloody <hi>Babilon</hi> to pine:</l>
               <l>That is his will that gaue King <hi>Iames</hi> a triple Crowne:</l>
               <l>A triple Crowne? what's that? a fatall terme, that is</l>
               <l>The triple Brittish Crowne, the Romish bane.</l>
               <l>As good <hi>Elizabeth</hi> raignes most happie now in heauen,</l>
               <l>So happie may King <hi>Iames</hi> raigne long with vs in earth:</l>
               <l>And as she did auoid the Iesuites treacherous traines,</l>
               <l>Whereby she gather graue in drie and quiet death,</l>
               <l>So good King <hi>Iames</hi> goe late to God and slip their snares,</l>
               <l>For if thou stick'st to God, they'l not sticke to sticke thee.</l>
